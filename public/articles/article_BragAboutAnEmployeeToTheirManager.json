Or perhaps there's a supplier in your chain who's so reliable you'd bet your last dollar on them. Maybe it's that HR associate who, rain or shine, is always there with a solution to every problem. These are the unsung heroes of our daily corporate lives. And if you've been fortunate enough to work with such individuals, it's time to sing their praises. üé§",

But here's a fun fact: Research shows that when employees believe they will be recognized, they are 2.7x more likely to be highly engaged.",

Remember that time the designer pulled an all-nighter to get the graphics just right for your presentation? Or when the supplier went out of their way to ensure timely delivery during a logistics nightmare? These are the stories their bosses need to hear.
